Hi 👋 My name is Sandor Madacsi
===============================

Creative Technologist / Developer
---------------------------------

I have been coding for 5 years. During my early education in the UK I got exposed to IT and it made sense for me to go down a developer path as I always enjoyed solving math problems. At Uni I realized that Software Engineering can be artful and be merged with different disciplines not closely related to technology. I love that the industry evolves at a rapid pace therefore encouraging me to improve with it. Nowadays I do Web Development and working on a new portfolio page done using NextJs.
